# peer-to-peer-app-v1.0.0
 Peer to peer CLI app to familiarize with libp2p specifications
 
 This app implements a basic file sharing mechanism using libp2p specification
 
 This project has some major drawbacks
 * won't work with more than two nodes
 
 
 This project is part of a self help excercise to improve and familiarize with libp2p
 
 Please only use this project as reference, and do not use it for file sharing ;-)
